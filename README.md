# SSI-metric

This repository provides a simple code to calculate the Solution Stability Index (SSI), a number between 0 and 1 that tells you how stable your simulation results are across three mesh levels: coarse, medium, and fine.

## üß† What is SSI?

When you refine your mesh, your simulation results should become more stable. But how do you measure that? This is where SSI comes in. It tells you ‚Äî using just the results ‚Äî how stable things are.

No need to know your mesh size, no need to calculate accuracy orders, just give the 3 output values (e.g. force, pressure, drag).

## üìå How to Calculate

Here‚Äôs how the SSI is calculated:

Step 1: average = abs((coarse + medium + fine) / 3)
Step 2: variation = abs(medium - coarse) + abs(fine - medium)
Step 3: penalty = 0.25 if the result is not consistent (i.e. it changes direction)
Step 4: SSI = 1 - (variation / average) - penalty


Final result is between 0 (very unstable) and 1 (very stable).

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use This Code

If you have Python installed:

1. Open terminal / command prompt
2. Run:

```bash
python ssi.py

You will see something like:
SSI = 0.7000

Example
Let‚Äôs say your results for a parameter were:

Coarse: 10.2

Medium: 9.8

Fine: 10.0

The code will calculate:
SSI = 0.7000

Where Can You Use This?
CFD: Pressure, torque, lift, drag
FEM: Displacement, stress
Heat Transfer: Nusselt number, surface heat flux
Multiphysics: Any scalar quantity affected by grid density
Any simulation: if you have 3 values from mesh refinement, SSI works
